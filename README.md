## Purpose
This repository contains standardized datasets that we are using to evaluate protein structural alignment methods and how they impact our results. These datasets include the following:
- Sets of structures for randomly selected human proteins (50,100,500,1000)
- Sets of random selected viral protein structures (50,100,500,1000) predicted by Nomburg et al. or Viro3D
- 'Target' protein pdbs for 4 proteins of interest (IL18BP, C4BP, IL10, EIF2A) from human, chimp, macaque, and mouse. These are considered positive controls.
- 3 viral representative sequences for each of the 4 target proteins. These are considered positive controls.

## Installation and Setup

This repository uses Snakemake to run the pipeline and conda to manage software environments and installations. You can find operating system-specific instructions for installing miniconda [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/). After installing conda and [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), run the following command to create the pipeline run environment.

```{bash}
TODO: Replace <NAME> with the name of your environment
mamba env create -n <NAME> --file envs/dev.yml
conda activate <NAME>
```

Snakemake manages rule-specific environments via the `conda` directive and using environment files in the [envs/](./envs/) directory. Snakemake itself is installed in the main development conda environment as specified in the [dev.yml](./envs/dev.yml) file.

To start the pipeline, run:

```{bash}
snakemake --software-deployment-method conda -j 8
```


## Data

Target protein pdbs were downloaded directly from [Alphafold](https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/).
Random viral protein datasets were generated by running the [viral snakemake file](viral.snakefile)
Random human protein datasets were generated by running the [human snakemake file](ranhum.snakefile)


### Compute Specifications

TODO: Describe what compute resources were used to run the analysis. For example, you could list the operating system, number of cores, RAM, and storage space.
